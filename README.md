# Unity-Essentials-Pathway

This project is the outcome of my game design learning through the **Unity Essentials Pathway** by Unity Learn. It’s a portfolio piece that showcases a variety of 2D and 3D game development, from scene setup to C# coding and WebGL publishing. Built with Unity 6000.2.6f2, this project is published to Unity Play, access it down below!

## What I’ve Learned
Here’s what I learned and built in this pathway:
- **Editor Essentials**: Explored the Unity Editor interface and mastered 3D scene navigation.
- **3D Essentials**: Created a tangram mural in the Scene view and furnished a kid’s bedroom with 3D assets.
- **Audio Essentials**: Designed immersive soundscapes.
- **2D Essentials**: Built a 2D room with 2D sprites and completed a 2D game.
- - **Programming Essentals (Scripting in C#)**:
  - Created a collectible that spawns a particle effect and play an audio clip when picked up.
  - Constrained the character movement based on the rotation and location axis
  - Constrained the character jump amount
  - Added sound effects to assets collisions
  - Added a time counter to the custom scene
  - Added a gamified version of the project, in which you get a win screen in case you get all collectibles in time, if not, you get a loose screen
- **Publishing**: Builded the project and published it to WebGL.
