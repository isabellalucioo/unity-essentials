# Unity-Essentials-Pathway

This project is the outcome of my game design learning through the **Unity Essentials Pathway** by Unity Learn. It’s a portfolio piece that showcases a variety of 2D and 3D game development, from scene setup to C# coding and WebGL publishing. Built with Unity 6000.2.6f2, this project is published to WebGL—check it out below!

## What I’ve Learned
Here’s what I learned and built in this pathway:
- **Editor Essentials**: Explored the Unity Editor interface and mastered 3D scene navigation.
- **3D Essentials**: Created a tangram mural in the Scene view and furnished a kid’s bedroom with 3D assets.
- **Audio Essentials**: Designed an immersive soundscapes.
- **2D Essentials**: Built a 2D room with 2D sprites and completed a 2D game.
- - **Programming Essentals (Scripting in C#)**:
  - Created a collectible that spawns a particle effect when picked up.
- **Publishing**: Packaged everything into a single portfolio project and published it to WebGL.
